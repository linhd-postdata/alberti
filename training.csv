Considerato che, commettendo il lavoro a case estere, oltre a recare danno non lieve all'industria italiana, si fanno risentire gravissime conseguenze alla ricchezza nazionale, e soprattutto alla classe lavoratrice, che, specialmente nel nostro Paese, attraverso, una crisi continua di lavoro, tanto e vero che precisamente l'Italia è la nazione che dà il maggior contingente di emigranti, che di anno in anno va aumentando, cercando in terre straniere quel lavoro e quel pane che la patria nega loro;MIGRA
Nella notte profonda del mare passa una nave. Quivi un’orda di emigranti sogna, medita e spera alla ricerca di una terra felice;MIGRA
Però da qualche tempo l'immigrazione italiana nella Repubblica Argentina segna una specie di stasi. Le cattive condizioni finanziarie del paese possono forse spiegare il fenomeno, ma sarebbe duro assai per l'avvenire d'Italia se quella corrente immigratoria che si è ora stabilita da tanti anni avesse a perdere della sua forza, se avesse a cessare quel flusso di emigranti italiani in Argentina che veniva di continuo a portare nuovo sangue nell'elemento italiano o ad aumentarne la forza economica;MIGRA
". Queste correnti di emigranti, che si diffondono per tutto il mondo, portano seco gran parte dell'anima nazionale, e,come nel medio-evo nelle nostre repubbliche marinaresche, questo movimento sarà fecondo di un migliore

Da febbraio ad ora siamo stati messi in guardia varie volte dal rischio di invasioni di milioni di immigrati. A Lampedusa ne sono arrivati cinquantacinquemila, certamente non pochi. (;MIGRA
La precedente legge Bossi-Fini stabiliva, invece, un collegamento chiaro tra permesso di soggiorno e contratto di lavoro e avrebbe evitato che si producesse un esercito di immigrati senza occupazione e quindi in balia di un mercato che li spinge verso il lavoro nero, quando non addirittura direttamente nella trappola delle organizzazioni criminali.;MIGRA
L'emergenza, dunque, valica il Mediterraneo e si estende all'Atlantico, ridicolizzando la proposta di soluzione avanzata ieri da alcuni dei leader della Lega: prendere a cannonate le piccole imbarcazioni dell'inesauribile esercito di potenziali immigrati clandestini.;MIGRA

The government plans to expel those who have not taken part in a census of immigrants that began a year ago. The government, faced with a huge influx of immigrants and finding them an economic burden, has already refused to register children of illegal immigrants at schools and has started fining employers who hire Afghans who do not have the proper documents.;MIGRA
Those who have registered for the census are still expected to return home eventually.;NONE
But while the government's response has been largely focused on the Southwest, the surge of child migrants is quickly becoming a crisis around the country. T;MIGRA
The fallout is being felt most acutely in places with large immigrant populations, like New York, where newly arrived children and their relatives are flooding community groups, seeking help in fighting deportation orders, getting health care, dealing with the psychological traumas of migration, managing the challenges of family reunification and enrolling in school.;MIGRA
By now the pattern is familiar. New businesses move to Altoona, creating low-paying, low-skill jobs that are quickly filled by immigrants. Most are Hispanics who speak little English.;NONE
After a few years, local leaders fume that school enrollment has surged, social services are stretched and crime has increased, and they blame the illegal immigrants.;MIGRA
If Hazleton, where the immigrant population grew sharply in just a few years, 140 started the current trend for dealing with a surge in illegal immigrants, Altoona may be the beginning of the next wave: trying to prevent a situation from developing in the first place.;MIGRA
Hundreds have died in the fighting, which started with an attempted coup on Sept. 19. The war and ethnic violence it is unleashing has forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, creating a tide of refugees that aid workers fear could spill across Ivory Coast's borders;MIGRA
Last year, hundreds of African migrants died when their boat capsized off the Italian island of Lampedusa. Two small Spanish enclaves in Morocco are frequently overrun by Africans seeking asylum. And the war in Syria has led to another tide of refugees. The influx has led to questions about whether the European Union needs a more comprehensive strategy to deal with the migrants at its borders;MIGRA
The Syrian civil war and violent expansion of the extremist Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, have caused a wave of destruction in Iraq and Syria and a vast flood of refugees into countries like Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon. Academics and their families have often been caught in that tumult.;MIGRA
The Obama administration has expanded the Secure Communities program rapidly across the country, saying that it helps federal agents identify illegal immigrants arrested by local authorities who have criminal histories. Under a policy started in June 2011, administration officials have sought to focus their enforcement efforts on deporting criminal convicts, while steering away from illegal immigrants arrested in minor offenses like traffic violations.;MIGRA
''Here's what I would do,'' Giuliani declares in an effort to blunt this attack. First, he would install a high-tech aerial monitoring system (''Borderstat,'' of course) that would tell you where, in the gaps along the physical border fence, illegal immigrants were crossing over;MIGRA
Then he would flood those hot spots with border guards, rather than trying to spread them out across the entire border. Once the flow of illegals had been stanched, the immigrants who were already here would seem like a more manageable population, and that problem would ''work itself out.';MIGRA
' Giuliani offers a specific timetable for sealing the border -- ''I think I could do this in about 18 months to three years'' -- as if he were making a reasonable bid to remodel your basement.;NONE

"Their knowledge grew with painstaking slowness over the years, though it began to accelerate in October 2000, after the attack on the Navy destroyer Cole. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, officials said, more than 500 Arab immigrants had been arrested or detained, most on immigration charges that could result in their 
deportation but not in criminal charges";MIGRA
Officials say more than 600 Arab and Muslim illegal immigrants were deported during the first wave of expulsions after Sept. 11. But the Justice Department stopped releasing figures after the number of arrested immigrants surged to 1,200, and officials have declined to give complete statistics for that period. Another wave of deportations began last year after officials said they planned to find and arrest illegal immigrants who pose security threats and already have deportation orders.;MIGRA
Of that group, more than 3,000 people have been arrested. Officials say they cannot say how many of those Arab and Muslim men have been deported.;NONE
Smugglers often hold the immigrants as ransom to extort more money from their families.;MIGRA
"Even those who 
are not being used for extortion are held captive to avoid detection by neighbours and to prevent the loss of money that

Law enforcement officials have arrested more than 30 smugglers and illegal immigrants trying to cross into the United States this year, already surpassing the number of such arrests in the area for all of 2002. (;MIGRA
Germany, Sweden and France were among the most sought-after destinations, particularly by Syrians, while Italy, the destination of thousands of migrants smuggled across the Mediterranean from North Africa, saw rising asylum claims from West African countries;MIGRA
That commitment, at least in Wilmington, arose from a historical model. Early in 2003, Salesianum High School here celebrated its centennial. The most renowned school in Wilmington, Salesianum had produced scores of lawyers and doctors and executives, and its tuition was $7,500 a year.;NONE

Gaza, the Palestinian coastal strip filled with refugees and hardship, is not generally thought of as a center of New Age sensibilities.;MIGRA
But through the intervention of a classically trained but alternative-seeking American psychiatrist, nearly 10,000 people there have been taught techniques to reduce anger, ease family tensions and give them a sense of control in an environment known for helplessness;NONE
Popularity has been a double-edged sword in Flushing, Queens, one of the city's most diverse neighbourhoods. Business owners welcome the droves of people who descend on its downtown sidewalks in search of scarves, massages and melons, as well as ginseng that can run a few hundred dollars an ounce;NONE
But many residents, including some of those busy business owners, say the teeming neighbourhood, filled with immigrants from South Korea, China, India and many other places, has become too crowded, according to people interviewed in the days before Tuesday's election;MIGRA
On the night of June 24, a van with its lights off and packed with illegal immigrants sped west in the eastbound lanes of Interstate 8 to avoid a Border Patrol checkpoint that sat only in the westbound lanes;MIGRA
The van sideswiped two cars, collided with a sport utility vehicle and then hit another van. The driver of the S.U.V. was killed, as were the driver of the wrong-way van and 4 of the 26 other people it carried. One of the 26, Alfred Alvarez Coronado, was arrested and charged with smuggling illegal immigrants.;NONE

The story was conceived by the Los Angeles screenwriter Daniel Knauf and begins with an 18-year-old, Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl), watching his mother die in a bare, dust-choked farmhouse in Oklahoma in 1934. Ben's tale is told in parallel to that of Brother Justin Crowe, a starchy Protestant preacher in a small California town that is under siege by swarms of desperate migrant workers;MIGRA
The play, which will run for 11 consecutive nights, centers on the idea that Marbury is a successful Beijing vagabond, or beipiao - a Chinese term typically used to refer to the millions of migrant workers who flock to the capital in search of employment without official Beijing residence permits;MIGRA
In the Islamic world, imams are defined as prayer leaders. But here, they become community leaders, essential intermediaries between their immigrant flocks and a new, Western land.;MIGRA
When Islamic traditions clash with American culture, it is imams who step forward with improvised answers. Outside the mosque, many assume the public roles of other clergy, becoming diplomats for their faith;NONE
South Texas is under siege from swarms of airborne migrants: tens of millions of Libytheana bachmanii larvata -- snout butterflies to y'all -- along with Kricogonia lysides, or yellow sulfurs, that have taken advantage of an unusual drought-and-deluge cycle to breed in spectacular if not record profusion;MIGRA
In quiet, discreet remarks, some in Pakistan's government contend that Jalozai is infested with Massoud supporters. The military government in Islamabad backs the Taliban.;NONE

Many communities see the workers' homes -- often overcrowded, usually with illegal immigrants -- as a blight and a safety hazard, and police and housing-code officers are sometimes dispatched to evict the occupants and fine the owners.;MIGRA
But the battle over immigration on Long Island has largely swirled past the cocineras, who say they see the homes simply as places to work;NONE
Mr. Dillon proclaims from the depths of a black leather sofa at the county courthouse.;NONE
Earlier this week, he announced his intention to convene a special grand jury to investigate a similarly fraught issue involving human rights, life and property: the blight of overcrowded housing of the largely illegal migrant work force that performs the county's most menial chores at menial rates.;MIGRA
Imposing challenges lie ahead, like finding Osama bin Laden and top Taliban leaders like Mullah Muhammmad Omar, securing the power of the new coalition government and feeding millions of refugees displaced by years of conflict;MIGRA
We often clashed with the first generation, whose minimal command of English traps them in a time-warped immigrant ghetto, but we identified even less with the second generation, who, with their Asian-American angst and anchorman English, struck us as even more foreign than the rest of America;MIGRA
At the same time, his administration has not done nearly enough to moderate enforcement policies that unfairly target citizens and legal residents -- often because they are Hispanic -- while feeding the fear and hopelessness of illegal immigrants as they await the opportunity to get right with the law;MIGRA
In theory, hordes of immigrants are a problem because they can take lots of jobs and drive down wages, especially for the less-educated natives in direct competition with them.;MIGRA
And I wouldn't worry about the economic menace of foreign manicurists. American workers have survived this immigrant invasion with their paychecks intact, and their fingernails in better shape than ever. (;MIGRA
Should the government's immigration agencies focus on law enforcement -- policing the borders to block the entry of illegal immigrants -- or on services to welcome hard-working new immigrants to American shores?;MIGRA
Continuing their efforts to curb the movement of illegal migrants and refugees, officials said that a migrant camp, in the sand dunes in Calais called ''the jungle,'' would be destroyed by year's end;MIGRA
For his part, Mr. Levy says the proliferation of illegal immigrants is threatening the quality of life in the county by driving up costs for schools, hospitals and jails.;MIGRA
Advocates see it as a tool for law enforcement to weed out illegal immigrants, while five lawsuits filed against it call it an infringement on federal authority and suggest that Latino citizens and legal residents will be swept up for questioning;MIGRA

During the summer months the influx is lightest: but from the latter part of September until the middle of December, and again from the last weeks of February until June 15, there is high tide at Ellis Island.;MIGRA
The stream of refugees from Reggio continues to pour in. The steamer Umberto has arrived here with four hundred, ninety-five of whom are wounded.;MIGRA
The captain of the Umberto says that nearly a hundred escaped prisoners were caught in the act of looting.;NONE
"He says that he saw famished survivors seize dogs, tear them to pieces, and eat the flesh ravenously. The steamer Sicilia has landed three ""hundred survivors from Messina";NONE
Some persons believe that the ebb and flow of immigrants during periods of prosperity and hard times is good for the country— that it is a safety valve through which dangerous and explosive elements escape, to the peace of society and the welfare of the state;MIGRA
The intimate Interests at all classes are the same. We should respect the law and enforce faithfully. It is the poor who most need the protection of the law. America has led the way in making the amplest provision for the education of children.;NONE
Education is not merely sending a boy into the world with knowledge, but ought to make him love knowledge.;NONE
There is no reason why the intellectual level of American nation should be lowered by the influx of millions of ignorant immigrants;MIGRA
In an Interview published in Baltimore The professor Thomas Rarigune Masaryk, of the University of Prague, and a member of the Austrian government fears for the safety of the United States because of the influx of uneducated immigrants.;MIGRA
"Speaking of the children in the crowded district of New fork, he asked: ""Who takes care of them?"" Then, to show how carefully he has studied the problem, he gives this piece of advice: ""There is ""only one remedy that l can think of. and that ""is to organise a movement to take care of these ""children, educate them, and elevate their moral condition.""";NONE
The Argentine race, like Its prototype in the United States, has been entirely formed by European immigration, and just as Anglo-Sax are a characteristics predominant In North America, owing to the greater portion of immigrants from Northern Europe, so in Argentina, the tide of immigration for years having flowed from Spain and Italy, are the characteristics of the race predominant.;MIGRA
"One of the most marked of these is a disinclination to exertion, which the Italians have summed up in the phrase ""Dolce far Niente"" (""the joy of doing nothing"";), so that anything that has to be done is carried out in the leisurely manner possible, and nothing is done one day that can possibly be put off tomorrow";NONE
"The remedy which he suggests for all the evils of immigration is ""that until such time as treaties can be concluded with immigrant conducing, the immigrants should be examined in their home district by an Itinerant board of not fewer than three American inspectors, chosen subject to the rules of the Civil Service.";NONE

" It is said that the government will try his plan. Mr J. E. C. Bodley, himself an Englishman, does not think that his countrymen pursue the right methods in the observation of foreign life. He says in his introduction to M. Emile Bounty's study of the English people that those Britons who are not casual pleasure seekers, but are settled in foreign lands for serious purposes, ""sometimes are as Insensible to the local and national interest of what is going on around them as are the holiday makers and amateurs of climate in a watering place."" We Imagine that the same thing might Just to be said of people of other races living in a foreign land";NONE
To facilitate the transportation of Immigrants admitted to this country by the authorities at Ellis Island, and to give the government absolute control of the Immigrant from the time he arrives on the Island until he reaches his destination, a huge Immigrant railroad station is to be erected off the western end of the Island at a cost aggregating of $ 200.000.;MIGRA
The station is to be built by the trunk ones interested, with the steamship company, in the Immigration business. The erection of this station, it was learned MIGRAterday, practically has been forced on the roads doing an immigrant business by the Commissioner Watchorn as one of the biggest ideas for the improvement in the methods of handling the increasing flood of Immigrants.;MIGRA
A few days after his appointment the Commissioner found that hundreds of immigrants who had received a clean bill of health at the Island frequently were taken to piers uptown and allowed to find their way to the stations from which they were to take trains for the West as best they could.;NONE
Some of them wandered about the city, and complaints reached the Commissioner from all parts of the country. in acme instances it was found that the treatment of the immigrants by the minor officials of the carrying roads was little short of the human. After his second month Commissioner Watchorn determined to make Ellis Island a humane Institution, and. incidentally, to facilitate the general business, an Immigrant station was needed.;MIGRA
This annual infusion of new blood into municipal life and enterprise is always a good thing for the city. Whether it is good for the particular individual depends chiefly upon himself, and as long as he cares to take the risk the city will profit by this accession to its potentialities;MIGRA
As respects immigrants, however, the case is far from similar, and it is a matter of grave concern whether in fusing and forming the new materials of citizenship annually seeking our shores by the hundreds of thousands, American cities will not suffer and deteriorate.;MIGRA
In many respects from the old time, high standards not only of living, but of morals and manners. The gravity of the problem is strikingly shown by the  comparative annual report for 1904 and 1906 of the Immigration Bureau of the Western Passenger Association, given to  the public the other day;NONE
From this report it will be seen that, of the 1,053,575 Immigrants landed at the various ports of the United States for the years mentioned, more than half remained in the larger cities, New York naturally heading the list as to the number of Immigrants. It retained and presumably is trying to assimilate;NONE
Nine states— the states of the biggest — received more than 20,000 immigrants each, and collectively absorbed 874.080, or four-fifths of the total number of arrivals.;MIGRA
There was the tendency to assemble in congested dormitories in groups of their own languages and nationality. How to break up this and obtain a better distribution was the problem;MIGRA
It would seem to be no feasible method of doing them. Family, national and religious ties and the nature of the employment to which they were accustomed all tended to bring them together;NONE
In the congested immigrant quarters of our large cities it is the alien tongue par excellence, the cleavage between the older generation, which mastering it in only primitive fashion, distrusts and even dislikes it and the younger one, which takes to It under the influence of its new environment, and, as is always the case with children, at the expense of the tongue of its ancestry.;MIGRA
Mary Grace Quacken of New York, special assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice to investigate and prepare the cases in the people cage prosecutions in the Southern States, has devised a method which she believes will prevent further occurrences of that character, will furnish labour in those sections of the country where it is most needed and avoid the congestion of Immigrants in the large cities.;MIGRA
Briefly, the work of the proposed department would be as follows: to develop Industries of the state by direct immigrant laborers to them;NONE
"to prevent congestion by getting immigrants out of the city; to improve the farming situation by encouraging investments and by sending immigrant laborers to work on them";MIGRA
The subject must be studied from many sides, and the weknesses of such legislation as has been tempted is that it has rested on insufficient data;NONE
Nobody really knows to what extent immigration is artificially stimulated, and nobody has as yet originated a plan whereby the evils of immigrant congestion in a few his cities and Industrial centres have to be overcome, if the inflow could be properly distributed the political mid social danger of assimilation would be minimised and the nation as a whole would be economically benefited.;MIGRA
The unprecedented rush of immigrants at Ellis Island inside the immigration building, where all must pass rigid inspection for character, disease and means of support;MIGRA
RUSH OF IMMIGRANTS. About 38,000 Landed in Eight Days —30,000 More This Week. Joseph Murray. Assistant. Commissioner of Immigration at this port, said to a Tribune reporter last evening. in discussing the spring rush of Immigration, that the steerage passengers for the last eight days;MIGRA
This will cause the lines carrying immigrants to keep them aboard In port at least two days, and their staying on Ells Island another two days, and by the time one-half are examined there will be thousands arriving on other vessels, so that the rush of Immigrants to this country will hardly be restored to the normal before two weeks. ;MIGRA
One Sunday a few months ago Commissioner Watchorn gave the employees on the island a rest on account of the unusual rush of immigrants to this country.;MIGRA
They were overworked then. The following day about five thousand aliens were in port;NONE
The late summer months will probably see a higher wage schedule in force for unskilled men in the harvest fields than ever before in the history of the Northwest;MIGRA
All this should be good news for the incoming tide of sturdy immigrants.;MIGRA
May they push forward to the work that awaits them in the open air and not huddle together in our cities!;MIGRA
Yet the last year has been so exceptionally prosperous that the attention of busy people should be called to some of the rest noteworthy accomplishments. ;NONE
If over a billion immigrants were absorbed in a single year without glutting  the labour market in any other nation sociologists would ponder the problem with amazement, but such an unheardof occurrence in the United States arouses little concerns;MIGRA
Dr. Douglas Hyde, founder of the Gaelic league, says he believes there will be 500.000,000 inhabitants of America in two generations, the swarm of Immigrants landing in New York this week may be mentioned as an incident confirmative of this prediction;MIGRA
Into those unsanitary tenement houses swarm the thousands of Immigrants who have been attracted by the opportunities for employment.;MIGRA
. They sleep, half a dozen or more in a single room, not infrequently men, women and children together, and drink freely of the had water. Fifty per cent of the Immigrants have typhoid within, two years of their coming to Pittsburgh, it is estimated.;NONE
Startled immigrants swarm at the Battery!;MIGRA
For a long time, it has been recognised by the students of immigration that the chief menace in the United States is a rapid assimilation of the swarms of immigrants who come hither in increasing numbers yearly.;MIGRA
"How well it would be could he be transported home, with all other unruly immigrants who flock to our shores from all parts of the world, defying our laws under the subterfuge that ""this is a land of liberty!""";MIGRA
Archbishop Ireland, of st. Paul, one of the leading spirits in the federation, has told to a close friends that while he favours a discrete sifting of the Immigrants flocking into the country, he will not favour a radical change In the law. His public utterances have led other leaders in the federation to believe that he might favour preventing immigrants without prospects tarrying in large centres like New York, Chicago, San Francisco;MIGRA
The desire of the South to get a larger share of the immigrants who are flocking to this country by the million is appreciated and reciprocated by the North. Nothing would please New;MIGRA
As to the treatment and feeding of the immigrants, the Commissioner says: The general treatment to which the Immigrants were subjected during the ten months preceding the chance In administration was not calculated to make upon them a favourable impression at the time of their first contact with the institutions of this country.;MIGRA
Frank Sargent of the Bureau of Immigration returned from New-Orleans this morning 1, and at once plunged into the mass of documents submitted by the various bidders for the Ellis Island contracts.;NONE
In addition to the bide, a large number of briefs and explanatory papers have been filed by those who are anxious to feed the Immigrants, transport their baggage and change their money;MIGRA
After looking over the work Commissioner General Sargent said that he would not be able to announce the names of the successful bidders until next week.;NONE
Immigrants are examined and passed. Following this Inspection, the students were shown through the rooms where Immigrants about to be deported are kept;NONE
The restaurant where Immigrants are fed was visited, with its large signs in four languages stating that meals are free;MIGRA
About the middle of June, he again called my attention to his desire for leave of absence;NONE
I pointed out to him the difficulties we had to contend with, that the department was in a formative stage, that we had large contracts for feeding the immigrants at Ellis Island and Other ports of entry to consider and dispose of.;MIGRA
Monetary extortion was practiced upon them, and there is ground for suspecting outright blackmail.;NONE
Through Inefficient or dishonest medical supervision or through the criminal connivance of steamship officials, contagious immigrants were passed in, as sound, and thus loathsome maladies hitherto unknown here were introduced into this country;MIGRA
. Don Emanuel Contrevas y Crooke, a Spanish nobleman, was herded with the dregs of infected at Ellis Island last week because a prosperous sister declined to receive him in her home in Jersey City;MIGRA
New York -alienists asked the Washington authorities for stricter regulations to keep out insane immigrants;MIGRA
"Unless Immigration can be diverted from Ellis Island or reduced there is need for additions to the facilities. ""There are no port with any adequate provision for handling immigrants"", declares the Secretary, ""although at most places sites have already been bought by the government for buildings to be used for these purposes""";NONE
Stricter regulation of steamship companies in the immigrant traffic is urged in the report and a system of fines for companies which bring insane immigrants or those afflicted with contagious diseases is proposed. The Secretary declares that the immigration officials even find it unwise to allow alien employees of steamships to land on American soil without applying the usual examination to them.;MIGRA
In petitioning the (Governor to reappoint Dr. Doty, some of the most eminent physician of this city have already pointed out the probability that next summer the danger of a cholera invasion from the Mediterranean will be greater than it was during last summer, when Dr. Duty's defensive measures proved so successful. With any but the strictest quarantine administration here in New York at that time the country may expect several shiploads of infected immigrant to be arrived;MIGRA
The erection of a hospital on an island in the harbor is made necessary by the action taken in September last by President Lederle when he informed Commissioner Williams that the Department of Health would, in the near future, terminate the agreement by which the city cared for cases of contagious diseases occurring among the immigrant at this port;MIGRA
The Health Commissioner of this city is quite right in serving notice upon the Federal Commissioner of Immigration that New-York, within the near future, will have to cease caring for immigrants afflicted with contagious diseases. That may be awkward for the Immigrant Bureau and may put it to considerable expense to provide other accommodations for its patients. But it really cannot be helped.;NONE
It is a physical impossibility for New York, in justice to itself and to its own citizens, to go on caring for these aliens. The fact that it is paid a fair price for so doing does not alter the matter. The city has not gone into the hospital business to make money, but to care for its own afflicted people.;MIGRA
This caution is considered the greatest in preventing the spread of any disease. The government hospital to be built near Ellis Island will take a great burden off the city authorities as the immigrants suffering from contagious diseases will be taken there instead of being sent in the city hospitals, where such patients have been a great burden;MIGRA
TO RELIVE THE CONGESTION. Notwithstanding this influence and the continued and well directed activity of philanthropic organizations, the Improvident and the undesirable immigrant continues to be a burden, the crowded district is becoming more crowded and the congestion continues to exercise a deteriorating influence on the health and the morals of those who make up the crowd.;MIGRA
The original Bulgars, a Turco Tartar race, with their language, laws and customs, were obliterated by hordes of immigrant Slavs;MIGRA
The annual spring rush of immigration to this port has begun early this year, and from the present outlook it promises to be heavy. Since a week ego, last Sunday, the arrivals amounted to 11,497. Thus far the Italians are in the lead of incoming aliens. Their number is unusually large, because many are returning from trips to the old country. It was rumoured MIGRAterday that the two policemen detailed at the Barge Office are to be removed and their places to be covered by a man on post.;NONE

There is no parallel between the cases of the Jews in Rumania and those in Russia. In the first place, it is said at the department that the United States had a ground for intervention because the Rumanian Government's action was injuring the United States by dumping a horde of undesirable Immigrants on her shores.;MIGRA
"It seemed at the Battery MIGRAterday as if a veritable immigrant armada had come to port. The timeworn expression ""Thousands lined the beach,"" was resurrected every little while in the afternoon, as the curious hopped off surface cars and the horde of enthusiastic humanity literally poured out of that hole in the ground known as the subway exit";MIGRA
Immigration officials at the principal Atlantic ports held a conference In Secretary Gage's office, discussing, among other things, the new order barring out Immigrants suffering from consumption.;MIGRA
I am quite sure that these conditions could be remedied without barring immigrants from this country altogether;MIGRA
The cities are the very spots where the troubles begin. Immigrants are allowed to land and wander at random in the cities. The consequence is that they must seek employment, and. being handicapped by their Ignorance of the country's ways and Its language, offer or are compelled to offer themselves to work for less money than an American can afford to work for. Are not the lawmakers responsible for such conditions?;MIGRA
